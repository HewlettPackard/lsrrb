# Step 1: Remove Minnow
Description: Stop Minnow service and remove Minnow package

    # systemctl stop minnow
    # rpm -qa | grep minnow
    minnow-1.1.0-2.x86_64
    # rpm -e minnow-1.1.0-2.x86_64
    # rm -rf /opt/hpe/minnow

# Step 2: Prerequisite for LSRRB package installation
Description: In LSRRB we added a mechanism to ensure that an accident rpm package installtion will not execute. If those prerequisites can not be satsified, LSRRB won't run. So here we need to satisfy the LSRRB prerequisites for upgrading to LSRRB. Those prequisites can be found in the latest KickStart file, so a fresh installation will have them.

Generate a bash script (e.g. upgrade_lsrrb.sh) containing the following lines:

    #!/bin/bash
    
    mkdir -p /etc/lsrrb
    PARTUUID=`sgdisk --info 1 /dev/sda | grep "unique" | tr /A-Z/ /a-z/ | cut -d" " -f4`
    echo "/dev/sda1" > /etc/lsrrb/esp_source_part
    echo $PARTUUID > /etc/lsrrb/esp_source_partuuid

Note: the above lines assume /dev/sda1 is the current booting volume. Replace with correct one when needed.

    # sh ./upgrade_lsrrb.sh

# Step 3: Install LSRRB package

    # rpm -ivh lsrrb-1.2.0-3.x86_64.rpm
